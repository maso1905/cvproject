# Description

This is a client of a REST webservice, located at my rest_webservice repo which uses JavaScript Fetch-method to catch data from a MySQL server. This project 
was a final exam project where we was suppose to create a personal curriculumn vitae and use Gulp, JavaScript, PHP and Sass. This client is suppose to only 
read and get information with fetch-method but due to deadline some parts of this project is hardcoded, but will be an only-read website in the future.

# How it works

Gulp-file was created to auto-build and create a public folder and Sass for better style structure. JavaScript was used to get data from MySQL server with 
Fetch-method. The user of this website can log in for administration functions with CRUD, see my cvadmin repo. Right now the username and password are hardcoded but will be stored in a
database soon to optimize security.
